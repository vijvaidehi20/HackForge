## 📝 Problem Statement

> Design an AI system that integrates real-time data from multiple sources (sales history, weather, social media sentiment, etc.) to predict future demand for retail products. The system should use RAG techniques to retrieve relevant data and generate accurate short-term and long-term demand forecasts. It should also autonomously manage inventory by optimizing stock levels and automating reorders to avoid stockouts and overstock situations. The main challenge is ensuring that the system works in real time and is scalable across different retail environments with varying product categories.
